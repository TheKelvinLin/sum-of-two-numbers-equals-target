# Sum of two numbers equals target
Given an array of integers, show the exponents of two numbers such that they add up to a specific goal. It can be assumed that there will be a solution for each input, and that the same element cannot be used twice.
<pre>
def twoSum(nums, target):
result=twoSum([11, 15, 1, 8], 12)
print(result) # show [0, 2] because nums[0]+nums[2] is 12
</pre>
